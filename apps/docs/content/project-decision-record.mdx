# Project Decision Record

## Decision

Initialize `rag-plus` as a pnpm + Turborepo monorepo with separate Node/TypeScript and Python service boundaries.

## Rationale

- Keep platform concerns isolated in `apps/rag-api`.
- Keep orchestration concerns isolated in `apps/orchestrator`.
- Keep docs and KB corpora separated to avoid accidental ingestion of spec documents.

## Status

Accepted for scaffold v1.
